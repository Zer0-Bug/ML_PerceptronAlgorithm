# ML_PerceptronAlgorithm
The primary goal of this project is to implement a classification task using the Perceptron learning algorithm. The task involves training a model on a provided dataset (TRAINData) and testing the model on a separate dataset (TESTData). 

The classification labels are binary (class 2 and class 4), and the model will predict these classes based on the attributes provided in the dataset.
